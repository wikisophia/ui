# Wikisophia UI

The Web UI for Wikisophia, running on [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/).

## Running Locally

Download and install [Node](https://nodejs.org/en/download/).

From the project root, run:

```sh
npm install
```

Build & run with:

```sh
npm run build
npm run dev
```

Open a browser and go to `http://localhost:4040` for the homepage.

## Running the API Server

The UI and API run on separate servers. You'll need to run the API at the same time
to get things working.

Docs for running API server can be found
[here](https://github.com/wikisophia/api/blob/master/server/docs/installation.md)
